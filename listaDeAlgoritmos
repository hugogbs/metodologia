## Algoritmos de ordenação

Insertion sort:
	Stable
	O(1) extra space
	O(n2) comparisons and swaps
	Adaptive: O(n) time when nearly sorted
	Very low overhead

Quick Sort 3:
	Not stable
	O(lg(n)) extra space
	O(n2) time, but typically O(n·lg(n)) time
	Adaptive: O(n) time when O(1) unique keys

Heap Sort:
	Not stable
	O(1) extra space (see discussion)
	O(n·lg(n)) time
	Not really adaptive

Quick Sort:
	Not stable
	O(lg(n)) extra space (see discussion)
	O(n2) time, but typically O(n·lg(n)) time
	Not adaptive

Counting sort:
